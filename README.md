### Hey there 👋

![Illustration of my little cat and I, with a text in the left side saying "Hey there, I'm Fabio Tetsuo" and "Frontend Developer and Content Creator"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44013819/105864289-8ab6bc80-5fd0-11eb-9f5d-a47642dee57c.png)


I'm passionate about front-end development, especially about tests! I already worked with a few javascript libs and frameworks, but React is my favorite one. I also love to learn new things, not only tech things... 😄
I'm currently trying to learn norwegian during my free time, improve some musical skills and I really love to spend some time cooking for my family.
