I'm passionate about front-end development, especially about tests! I already worked with a few javascript libs and frameworks, but React is my favorite one. I also love to learn new things, not only tech things... ðŸ˜„
I'm currently trying to learn norwegian during my free time, improve some musical skills and I really love to spend some time cooking for my family.
