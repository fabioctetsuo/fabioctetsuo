### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

![Illustration of my little cat and I, with a text in the left side saying "Hey there, I'm Fabio Tetsuo" and "Frontend Developer and Content Creator"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44013819/105862825-fe57ca00-5fce-11eb-970b-83e9d1730c6e.png)

I'm passionate about front-end development, especially about tests! I already worked with a few javascript libs and frameworks, but React is my favorite one. I also love to learn new things, not only tech things... ðŸ˜„
I'm currently trying to learn norwegian during my free time, improve some musical skills and I really love to spend some time cooking for my family.
